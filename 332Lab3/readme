We got the linux setup wokring on the DE1-SoC board by flashing the image through Rufus and connecting it to the lab windows desktop.
we worked on copying over the required files to the intelFPGA folder on the C drive and ran the quartus analysis and synthesis.
we used the synthesis to compile the .AOCX file
